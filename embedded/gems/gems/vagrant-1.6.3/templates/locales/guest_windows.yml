        The provider being used to start Windows ('%{provider}')
        doesn't support the "nic_mac_addresses" capability which is required
        for advanced networking to work with Windows guests. Please inform
        the author of the provider to add this feature.

        Until then, you must remove any networking configurations other
        than forwarded ports from your Vagrantfile for Vagrant to continue.
      network_winrm_required: |-
        Configuring networks on Windows requires the communicator to be
        set to WinRM. To do this, add the following to your Vagrantfile:

          config.vm.communicator = "winrm"

        Note that the Windows guest must be configured to accept insecure
        WinRM connections, and the WinRM port must be forwarded properly from
        the guest machine. This is not always done by default.
